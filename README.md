Welcome to My Data Science and Machine Learning Projects!
ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hello! I'm a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast. On this GitHub account, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from exploratory data analysis and visualization to machine learning model development and deployment.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview
Customer-Segmentation-RFM-KMeans

A project focused on customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering. This project demonstrates the process of identifying distinct customer segments to optimize marketing strategies.

Sentiment Analysis with BERT

An implementation of sentiment analysis using the BERT model. This project explores the power of transformers in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically in classifying text sentiments.

Predictive Modeling and Analysis

A collection of projects where I apply different machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on various datasets. This includes regression, classification, and more advanced techniques.
